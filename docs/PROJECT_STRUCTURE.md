# DNA GAN Project Structure

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the project structure and the contents of each folder.

## Project Overview

The DNA GAN Project implements and compares two different GAN architectures for generating synthetic DNA sequences:

1. **Gumbel-Softmax GAN**: A basic implementation using LSTM generators with the Gumbel-Softmax trick
2. **Improved WGAN-GP**: An advanced implementation using Wasserstein GAN with gradient penalty, LSTM generators with attention, and CNN discriminators with spectral normalization

## Running the Streamlit App

The Streamlit app provides a user-friendly interface for visualizing and comparing the original and generated DNA sequences.

To run the Streamlit app:

```bash
cd DNA_GAN_Project
python run_streamlit_app.py
```

If you don't have the necessary data files, you can generate dummy data for visualization:

```bash
python run_streamlit_app.py --prepare-data
```

The app will be available at http://localhost:8501 in your web browser.
