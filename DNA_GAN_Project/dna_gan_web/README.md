# DNA Sequence Analysis Dashboard

This enhanced web interface allows you to:

1. View original DNA sequences from the EPD database
2. View sequences generated by Gumbel-Softmax GAN
3. View sequences generated by Wasserstein GAN with Gradient Penalty
4. Compare and analyze all three datasets with interactive visualizations

## Running the App

```bash
# On Windows
run_simplified_app.bat

# On Unix/MacOS
chmod +x run_simplified_app.sh
./run_simplified_app.sh
```

## Features

- **Interactive Visualizations**: All plots are interactive using Plotly
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: GC content, nucleotide distribution, k-mer analysis
- **Side-by-Side Comparison**: Compare original and generated sequences
- **Detailed Metrics**: Statistical analysis of sequence properties
- **Responsive UI**: Clean, modern interface with intuitive navigation

## Generating Sequences

The app includes functionality to generate random DNA sequences for testing purposes. In a real-world scenario, these would be replaced with sequences generated by the actual GAN models.

To generate sequences:
1. Navigate to the Home page
2. Click on the "Generate Gumbel-Softmax Sequences" or "Generate Improved WGAN-GP Sequences" button
3. The sequences will be generated and saved to the appropriate files

## Comparing Models

The Model Comparison page provides a comprehensive comparison of the original data and the sequences generated by both models. This includes:
- Metrics comparison (GC content, sequence length, nucleotide frequencies)
- Visualizations of nucleotide distributions
- Comparison of k-mer frequencies
- Detailed analysis of the differences between the models
