# DNA Sequence Generation using GANs

This project implements and compares two different GAN architectures for generating synthetic DNA sequences:

1. **Gumbel-Softmax GAN**: A basic implementation using LSTM generators with the Gumbel-Softmax trick
2. **Improved WGAN-GP**: An advanced implementation using Wasserstein GAN with gradient penalty, LSTM generators with attention, and CNN discriminators with spectral normalization

## Requirements

- Python 3.10
- PyTorch
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- tqdm
- BioPython
- scikit-learn
- Streamlit (for visualization)

## Installation

1. Create a virtual environment with Python 3.10:
   ```bash
   python -m venv env310
   ```

2. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```bash
   # On Windows
   env310\Scripts\activate

   # On Unix or MacOS
   source env310/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install torch numpy matplotlib tqdm scikit-learn biopython streamlit
   ```

## Running the Models

### Quick Start

1. **Check CUDA Availability**:
   ```bash
   python -m utils.check_cuda
   ```

2. **Prepare the Data**:
   ```bash
   # Extract and preprocess the FASTA content
   .\preprocess_and_check.bat  # On Windows
   ./preprocess_and_check.sh   # On Unix/MacOS
   ```

3. **Run the Model with CUDA**:
   ```bash
   # Train the model with CUDA support
   .\run_with_cuda.bat  # On Windows
   ./run_with_cuda.sh   # On Unix/MacOS
   ```

4. **Run the Evaluation**:
   ```bash
   # Run the evaluation with fixed paths
   .\run_evaluation_fixed.bat  # On Windows
   ./run_evaluation_fixed.sh   # On Unix/MacOS
   ```

### Gumbel-Softmax GAN

To train the Gumbel-Softmax GAN:

```bash
cd DNA_GAN_Project
python -m models.gumbel_softmax_gan.run_dna_gan --fasta_file data/preprocessed_dna_sequences.fasta --num_epochs 1000
```

To resume training from a checkpoint:

```bash
python -m models.gumbel_softmax_gan.run_dna_gan --resume checkpoints/gumbel_softmax_gan/checkpoint_epoch_X.pt
```

### Improved WGAN-GP

To train the Improved WGAN-GP:

```bash
cd DNA_GAN_Project
python -m models.improved_wgan.run_improved_dna_gan --fasta_file data/preprocessed_dna_sequences.fasta --num_epochs 500
```

To resume training from a checkpoint:

```bash
python -m models.improved_wgan.run_improved_dna_gan --resume checkpoints/improved_dna_gan/checkpoint_epoch_X.pt
```

## Visualization with Streamlit

The project includes a Streamlit app for visualizing and comparing the original and generated DNA sequences.

To run the Streamlit app:

```bash
cd DNA_GAN_Project
python -m run_comparison_app
```

If you don't have the necessary data files, you can generate dummy data for visualization:

```bash
python -m run_comparison_app --prepare-data
```

The Streamlit app provides the following features:
- View original DNA sequences
- Explore generated sequences from both models
- Compare evaluation metrics
- Visualize training progress
- Comprehensive evaluation of real vs. synthetic sequences

## Evaluation

The project includes a comprehensive evaluation module for comparing real and synthetic DNA sequences:

1. **Feature-Based Sequence Comparisons**:
   - GC content analysis
   - k-mer frequency analysis
   - Motif analysis
   - DNA structural property analysis

2. **Statistical & Machine Learning Approaches**:
   - Dimensionality reduction and clustering
   - Classifier-based discrimination
   - Distributional tests

3. **Functional & Predictive Analyses**:
   - Promoter strength prediction
   - Downstream model training

To run the evaluation:

```bash
cd DNA_GAN_Project
.\run_evaluation_fixed.bat  # On Windows
./run_evaluation_fixed.sh   # On Unix/MacOS
```

The evaluation results are displayed in the Streamlit app under the "Evaluation" tab.

## Model Comparison

The Improved WGAN-GP model offers several advantages over the Gumbel-Softmax GAN:

1. **More Stable Training**: The Wasserstein loss with gradient penalty provides more stable training, avoiding the mode collapse observed in the Gumbel-Softmax GAN.

2. **Better Diversity**: The generated sequences show higher diversity, as measured by both sequence diversity and k-mer diversity metrics.

3. **More Realistic GC Content**: The GC content of generated sequences is closer to that of real DNA sequences.

4. **Improved Spatial Patterns**: The Moran's I spatial autocorrelation of generated sequences is closer to that of real DNA sequences.

5. **Attention Mechanism**: The self-attention mechanism helps capture long-range dependencies in DNA sequences.

6. **Spectral Normalization**: Spectral normalization in the discriminator provides more stable gradients during training.

## Troubleshooting

### CUDA Not Available

If CUDA is not available or not being used:

1. Check CUDA availability:
   ```bash
   python -m utils.check_cuda
   ```

2. Install PyTorch with CUDA support:
   ```bash
   pip uninstall torch
   pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
   ```

### Path Issues

If you encounter path issues:

1. Make sure you're running the scripts from the project root directory:
   ```bash
   cd DNA_GAN_Project
   ```

2. Use the fixed scripts:
   ```bash
   .\run_evaluation_fixed.bat  # On Windows
   ./run_evaluation_fixed.sh   # On Unix/MacOS
   ```

### BioPython Issues

If you encounter issues with BioPython:

1. Make sure you have the latest version:
   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade biopython
   ```

2. Use the fixed scripts which include workarounds for common BioPython issues.
