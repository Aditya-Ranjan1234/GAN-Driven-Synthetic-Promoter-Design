# DNA Sequence Data

This directory contains the data files used for training and evaluation.

## Expected Files

- **clean_all_dna_sequences.fasta**: Original DNA sequences
- **gumbel_generated_sequences.fasta**: Sequences generated by the Gumbel-Softmax GAN
- **improved_generated_sequences.fasta**: Sequences generated by the Improved WGAN-GP

## Data Format

All data files are in FASTA format, which consists of:
- A header line starting with '>' followed by a sequence identifier
- One or more lines containing the sequence data

Example:
```
>sequence_1
ACGTACGTACGTACGT
>sequence_2
GCTAGCTAGCTAGCTA
```

## Generating Dummy Data

If you don't have the actual data files, you can generate dummy data for visualization:

```bash
python ../run_streamlit_app.py --prepare-data
```

This will create dummy FASTA files with synthetic sequences for demonstration purposes.
